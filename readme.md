The objective of this exercise was to manipulate and represent meteorological data stored in an XML document.
The XML document contains temperature measurements for various cities on specific dates.
Each <mesure> element is qualified by a date attribute and contains multiple <ville> elements, each with a nom (city name) and temperature attribute.
The tasks included creating DTDs, XML schemas, HTML and SVG representations, and visualizations.
